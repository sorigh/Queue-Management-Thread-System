# Queue-Management-Thread-System

A simulation system that models the behavior of clients waiting in line at multiple service lines. The system uses threading and various queue strategies to distribute clients to servers, based on different selection policies, while providing real-time statistics and progress updates via a graphical interface.

## Features

- **Threaded Simulation**: Simulates multiple clients arriving at random times and being served by servers, each managed by separate threads.
- **Selection Strategies**: Implements two main strategies for client distribution:
  - **Shortest Time Strategy**: Assigns clients to servers based on the shortest service time.
  - **Shortest Queue Strategy**: Assigns clients to servers based on the shortest queue length.
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time updates on the simulation status, including average waiting and service times, peak hour data, and remaining clients in queues.
- **Statistics**: At the end of the simulation, the system computes and displays important statistics like average waiting time, average service time, peak hour, and the total number of clients served.

## Results

The simulation was run for three different data sets using both strategies to observe the differences in the results generated by each.

### Strategy Results:

| Strategy        | Test 1 | Test 2 | Test 3 |
|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Shortest Time** | Average Waiting Time: 0.12s <br> Average Service Time: 2.5s <br> Peak Hour: at second 15 with 1 person | Average Waiting Time: 1.52s <br> Average Service Time: 3.08s <br> Peak Hour: at second 30 with 11 people | Average Waiting Time: 70.83s <br> Average Service Time: 4.49s <br> Peak Hour: at second 100 with 599 people |
| **Shortest Queue** | Average Waiting Time: 0.12s <br> Average Service Time: 2.75s <br> Peak Hour: at second 5 with 1 person | Average Waiting Time: 2.5s <br> Average Service Time: 3.62s <br> Peak Hour: at second 40 with 14 people | Average Waiting Time: 108.38s <br> Average Service Time: 5.5s <br> Peak Hour: at second 100 with 663 people |

### Observations:

- **Test 1**: Conducted with a small number of clients, the test did not result in a scenario where multiple clients arrived at the same time, or a client arrived when a queue was already occupied. As a result, there was no noticeable difference between the two strategies. The queues remained mostly empty during the simulation, resulting in almost non-existent waiting times. The ratio between clients and queues was about 1 queue for every 2 clients.

- **Test 2**: With a larger number of clients and more varied service times, there were instances where two clients arrived at the same time, or one client arrived when a queue was already occupied. In this scenario, differences between the two strategies were observed. The **Shortest Time** strategy resulted in an average waiting time approximately 1 second lower than the **Shortest Queue** strategy. However, waiting times remained relatively low for both strategies. The ratio between clients and queues was about 1 queue for every 10 clients.

- **Test 3**: A large-scale simulation was conducted with a significant number of clients, requiring efficient allocation across a limited number of queues. The ratio was about 1 queue for every 50 clients. In both strategies, the queues remained full until the simulation reached its maximum time limit, but the number of clients and waiting times varied between the two strategies. 

### Queue Observations at Second 200:

| Strategy        | Shortest Queue | Shortest Time |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Clients Remaining** | 14 – 17 clients per queue <br> 301 clients in total | 7 – 9 clients per queue <br> 151 clients in total |
| **Waiting Time** | 70 to 90 seconds per queue | 28 to 34 seconds per queue |

As seen, for the **Shortest Queue** strategy, the simulation time would need to be extended by approximately 1/3 to complete client processing. In contrast, the **Shortest Time** strategy only required about 1/5 more time. The number of unserved clients for the **Shortest Queue** strategy was twice as large as that for the **Shortest Time** strategy.

### Conclusion

It is clear that the **Shortest Time** strategy optimizes the placement of clients in queues based on the time they require to be served. This efficiency is clearly reflected in the results of the simulation, where the **Shortest Time** strategy consistently outperforms the **Shortest Queue** strategy in terms of the number of clients served and the overall waiting time.
